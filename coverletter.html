					<p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
						
					<p>
						I am writing to express my interest in an internship position at [Company Name]. 
						As a student majoring in Data Analytics, I have developed a solid foundation in data management and 
						analysis, with hands-on experience in SQL, HTML, and CSS through my coursework. These skills have allowed
						me to complete several individual projects, including designing a personal portfolio website and creating SQL 
						queries to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. These projects have not only sharpened my technical 
						skills but also strengthened my ability to approach challenges independently and deliver results.
					</p>
						
					<p>
						While I have not yet had the opportunity to work on group projects, my individual experiences have 
						taught me the importance of time management, attention to detail, and adaptability in solving 
						real-world problems. I am particularly eager to apply my growing technical expertise to the field of
						data engineering, where I can contribute to building efficient data pipelines and systems that drive business decisions. 
						[Company Name]’s innovative approach to [specific company initiative or value] resonates deeply with me, 
						and I would be honored to learn and grow as part of your team.
					</p>
						
					<p>Sincerely,</p>
						
					<p><span>Rebecca Wells</span></p>
